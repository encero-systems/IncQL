# IncQL

**IncQL** is the **typed data logic plane** for governed relational work, implemented as an [Incan](https://github.com/encero-systems/incan) library package. It is where you express **relational queries**, **schema-aware table transformations**, and **streaming-shaped relational work** with compile-time checks, without folding orchestration, catalogs, or engine-specific runtime into the authoring model. Row shapes come from Incan `model` types; column, join, and alias rules are part of one semantic core whether you use `query { }` blocks, method chains on `DataSet[T]` carriers, or (later) optional pipe-forward (`|>`).

**What IncQL is not:** It is not a pipeline or workflow framework, not a semantic catalog, and not a catch-all that swallows execution concerns. It owns **data logic**: query authoring, relational plan shape, resolution and schema flow, typed carrier semantics, and **backend-neutral logical intent**. Execution, binding, and operational semantics live in the layer below (session, adapters, runners).

**Why it matters:** Raw SQL strings and untyped rows defer mistakes to runtime. IncQL keeps relational work **in source**: schemas are ordinary models, invalid references and many aggregation mistakes are caught by the typechecked authoring surface, and plans are intended to lower to **Apache Substrait** so logical intent stays portable while credentials and physical reads are resolved outside the normative plan story.

**Bottom line:** IncQL provides **checked relational logic** for data systems: the same naming and schema rules apply to `query { }` blocks and `DataSet[T]` APIs, and **execution stays downstream** (sessions, adapters, runners) and consistent.

## What you get

- **Carriers that know their row type** — `DataFrame[T]`, `LazyFrame[T]`, and `DataStream[T]` share a `DataSet[T]` surface; bounded vs unbounded is reflected in the type hierarchy so unsafe streaming operations can be rejected at compile time.
- **SQL-familiar `query { }` blocks** — Clause-oriented relational syntax, typed against the current query schema, aligned with the same resolution rules as method chains.
- **One naming model** — `.column`, `alias.column`, bare names in the query schema, and ordinary Incan bindings are specified so blocks, chains, and future surfaces stay equivalent where it counts.
- **A registry-backed function catalog** — Core operators, aggregates, common scalar functions, window helpers, generators, nested-data helpers, and compatibility aliases share one checked helper model and carry portable metadata for Substrait and backend adapters. Typed helpers accept primitives where that is the natural authoring shape, such as `add(col("amount"), 1)`, `substring(col("sku"), 1, 3)`, or `cast(col("amount_text"), float)`, while query-schema validation checks referenced column types during planning and lowering.
- **Portable logical plans** — Substrait is the normative interchange; read roots stay logical while binding and execution stay in the session layer (see RFCs 002 and 004).
- **Local plan inspection** — Prism-backed lazy plans can be inspected as structured records with semantic targets, output schema, Prism nodes, lineage edges, artifact-family summaries, and explicit unsupported-evidence markers.

Design is **RFC-driven**; **[docs/rfcs/](docs/rfcs/README.md)** is the source of truth.

## Design (RFCs)

Normative proposals live under **[docs/rfcs/](docs/rfcs/README.md)**. IncQL’s RFC series is separate from [Incan’s RFC index](https://github.com/encero-systems/incan/tree/main/workspaces/docs-site/docs/RFCs).

## Project layout

- `Makefile` — build, test, and format targets (`make help`)
- `incan.toml` — package manifest
- `src/lib.incn` — public exports
- `src/` — library modules
- `tests/` — tests
- `mkdocs.yml` — documentation site configuration for the `docs/` tree
- `.github/workflows/` — CI for package checks, strict docs builds, and GitHub Pages deployment

Build and test from this repo root (with `incan` on your `PATH`):

```bash
make ci
```

Or invoke the toolchain directly:

```bash
incan build --lib
incan test tests
```

See `make help` for other targets (`fmt`, `fmt-check`, `registry-metadata`, `build-locked`, …). Continuous integration builds **Incan from source** from the workflow's pinned `INCAN_REF` release branch or tag, then runs `fmt-check`, `test-style`, function registry metadata validation, `build`, `test`, and the pub-consumer smoke check (see [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml)). The docs workflow runs `mkdocs build --strict` for documentation changes and publishes the site to GitHub Pages from `main` or manual dispatch; see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the local docs build loop.
