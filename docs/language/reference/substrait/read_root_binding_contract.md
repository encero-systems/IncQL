# Substrait read-root and binding contract (Reference)

This page is the **operational reference** for IncQL's normative boundary between logical read roots in Substrait plans and execution-context binding. The normative rule — that logical reads carry names and virtual values rather than secrets, and that the execution context resolves them — lives in [IncQL RFC 002][rfc-002]. This page expands on the `ReadRel` variant requirements, what a read must and must not contain, the execution context's obligations, and the adapter layer boundary.

## Normative boundary

IncQL relational plans **must** express all new data entering the plan as logical reads. A logical read carries a **logical identity** — a name, a virtual row set, or an opaque extension type — without normative dependence on:

- Secret material: credentials, tokens, API keys, or passwords.
- Host-specific connection strings, DSNs, or URIs that encode execution-context policy.
- Engine-specific physical scan parameters that would need to change when the plan is executed on a different conforming consumer.

The execution context **must** resolve logical reads to physical resources through its adapter and execution layer. That resolution **must not** redefine the relational semantics of the plan. The plan's meaning — which rows, which columns, which schema — is fixed at authoring time by the logical read; the execution context only supplies the physical source.

## `ReadRel` variant reference

| Variant        | Substrait field                            | Typical IncQL use                                                 | Portability                                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NamedTable`   | `named_table` (list of name parts)         | Registered logical table name; resolved by session registry      | Portable across conforming consumers that have registered the same logical name        |
| `LocalFiles`   | `local_files` (file list + format options) | Parquet, CSV, Arrow IPC scan from a URI                          | Portable if consumers can resolve the URI; URI format is not standardized by Substrait |
| `VirtualTable` | `virtual_table` (inline rows)              | Literal or embedded row data                                     | Fully portable; rows are embedded directly in the plan                                 |
| Extension leaf | `ExtensionLeafRel`                         | Custom source type with no applicable standard `ReadRel` variant | Extension-URI-dependent; portability requires consumers to support the registered URI  |

### What a `ReadRel` must carry

- The **logical identity** of the source: name parts for named tables, format type and URI pattern for file scans, or inline data for virtual tables.
- The **base schema** (a Substrait `NamedStruct`): field names and types must match the Incan `model` `T` that parameterizes the resulting `DataSet[T]`.
- Any **filter or column hints** permitted by the pinned Substrait spec (for example, scan-level filter fields on `ReadRel`); these are optimization hints, not semantic changes, and consumers that do not support them must still produce semantically correct results.

### What a `ReadRel` must not carry (in the normative interchange)

- Raw connection strings, credentials, DSN passwords, or any secret material.
- Engine-specific scan parameters that would fail or behave differently on a different conforming consumer unless declared as a registered extension.
- Schema definitions that contradict or override the Incan `model` type checked at compile time.

## Execution context responsibilities

The execution context ([IncQL RFC 004][rfc-004] `Session`) **must**:

1. Maintain a **table registry** that maps logical names to physical data source definitions (connection parameters, catalog references, or file paths).
2. **Resolve** `ReadRel` logical names through this registry at execution time — not at plan authoring time — so the serialized plan remains independent of execution-context state.
3. **Supply credentials and connection details** from its own configuration layer, never by reading them from the serialized Substrait plan.
4. Apply any **governance policy** (access control, row filtering, schema masking) that is sensitive enough to keep out of the portable plan, by injecting it at resolution time.
5. **Validate** that the resolved physical source schema is compatible with the `NamedStruct` declared in the `ReadRel` before execution begins.

## Adapter boundary

Product SDKs and higher operational layers **may** provide convenience read APIs (for example, `session.read_csv(name, uri)` returning a typed `LazyFrame[T]` by inference) wrapping registration + `ReadRel` resolution. These convenience surfaces:

- **Must** produce a `ReadRel` in the normative Substrait interchange with the logical identity encoded appropriately for the variant.
- **Must not** embed execution-context state — resolved credentials, session tokens, resolved endpoint URLs — in the `ReadRel` payload of the normative plan.
- **May** pass execution-context configuration through separate, non-normative channels (for example, `AdvancedExtension` hints, out-of-band session configuration) when needed for optimization, provided the plan remains semantically valid without them.

Adapter-specific "open connection" or "bind source" APIs **should not** be specified as core IncQL. They are thin wrappers at most, with the binding contract owned by the execution context per IncQL RFC 004.

## Interaction with IncQL RFC 001 types

The following table summarizes how each `Session` read method maps to a `ReadRel` variant and the resulting IncQL carrier type.

| `Session` method                     | Returns        | `ReadRel` variant                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `session.table(name)`             | `LazyFrame[T]` | `NamedTable`                                      |
| `session.read_csv(name, uri)`     | `LazyFrame[T]` | `NamedTable` (via Session registration + binding) |
| `session.read_parquet(name, uri)` | `LazyFrame[T]` | `NamedTable` (via Session registration + binding) |
| `session.read_arrow(name, uri)`   | `LazyFrame[T]` | `NamedTable` (via Session registration + binding) |

In all cases the `LazyFrame[T]` holds a deferred plan — no data is fetched until Session execution is triggered by `session.execute(...)`, `session.collect(...)`, a convenience call such as `lazy.collect()`, or a Session-owned write. The `ReadRel` in the deferred plan carries only the logical identity; resolution to a physical source happens at execution time per the execution context obligations described above.
