# Substrait operator catalog (Reference)

This page is the **operational mapping reference** for IncQL's Apache Substrait integration. The normative contract — including the Logical `Rel` alphabet, pinning policy, read-root boundary, and extension URI rules — lives in [IncQL RFC 002][rfc-002]. This page provides the full capability → `Rel` catalog, profile tags, gap encoding requirements, and optional mutation profile detail that are too long-lived and versioned to remain inside the RFC text itself.

## Profile tags

Each entry in the catalog carries one of the following profile tags:

| Tag                   | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **core**              | Maps to a standard logical `Rel` in the pinned Substrait revision; portable across conforming consumers without additional extension registration                                              |
| **extension**         | Requires a registered extension URI; portability depends on consumer support for that URI                                                                                                      |
| **gap**               | No stable logical `Rel` exists in current core Substrait; **must** use a documented non-core encoding (see [Gap profiles](#gap-profiles)); ad hoc or undocumented encodings are non-conforming |
| **optional-mutation** | Part of the optional mutation profile; not required for read/query analytical core; may be omitted by distributions that target read-only analytical use                                       |

The same status taxonomy is used in the [Substrait conformance corpus][ref-conformance-corpus]. Scenario contracts in that corpus are represented as typed IncQL models with stable scenario IDs so CI and downstream implementations can consume a stable machine contract.

## Read/query analytical core profile

The following table maps IncQL plan capabilities to Substrait logical relations and expression patterns for the read/query analytical core — the minimum required for IncQL v0.1.

## Optional mutation profile

The following capabilities are part of the optional mutation profile. They are **not** required for IncQL read/query analytical core (v0.1). An implementation that exposes any mutation-profile capability **must** document which relations are supported for its target backend and what portability guarantees (if any) apply.

| IncQL capability                              | Substrait   | Profile           |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Write to a table / CTAS                       | `WriteRel`  | optional-mutation |
| Table update without a full child `Rel` input | `UpdateRel` | optional-mutation |
| DDL (create, drop, alter)                     | `DdlRel`    | optional-mutation |

Absence of these in a given distribution does not make IncQL incomplete for read-only analytical use.

## Extension escape hatches

When no standard logical `Rel` covers a required operation and no gap encoding policy applies, implementations **may** use the following extension escape hatches. Any use **must** be declared in the public operator catalog for the toolchain version and assigned a stable, registered extension URI.

| Extension `Rel`      | When appropriate                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ExtensionLeafRel`   | Source/scan with no applicable standard `ReadRel` variant     |
| `ExtensionSingleRel` | Single-input transformation with no applicable standard `Rel` |
| `ExtensionMultiRel`  | Multiple-input relation with no applicable standard `Rel`     |

Using an extension escape hatch without a registered URI is non-conforming.

## Gap profiles

### Unnest / explode

Core Substrait does not define a portable unnest or explode `Rel` at the logical level. Until a stable logical `Rel` for unnest is adopted in the pinned Substrait revision and recognized by IncQL:

- `EXPLODE`-style behavior **must** lower through a registered extension relation (`ExtensionSingleRel` or `ExtensionLeafRel`) with a declared extension URI in the toolchain's public catalog.
- Alternatively, a documented rewrite (for example, expanding a virtual table) **may** be used if the encoding is unambiguously specified in the public operator catalog for the toolchain version.
- Implementations **must not** present ad hoc or undocumented unnest encodings as portable core behavior.

Current package-level RFC 002 boundary registration:

- `https://incql.io/extensions/v0.1/unnest.yaml#explode`
- `https://incql.io/extensions/v0.1/unnest.yaml#explode_outer`
- `https://incql.io/extensions/v0.1/unnest.yaml#posexplode`
- `https://incql.io/extensions/v0.1/unnest.yaml#posexplode_outer`

### Pivot / unpivot

No core Substrait `Rel` covers pivot/unpivot directly:

- The canonical encoding is a documented rewrite to `JoinRel` + `AggregateRel` + `ProjectRel`.
- Alternatively, `ExtensionSingleRel` **may** be used with a registered URI.
- The chosen encoding **must** be documented in the public operator catalog for the toolchain version.

### Asof / interval joins

Asof and interval joins fall outside `JoinRel`'s standard join type enum:

- They **may** be expressed as a `JoinRel` with a complex non-equi join expression only where the consumer's documentation explicitly states it handles such expressions correctly.
- If expressed as an extension, a registered URI is required.
- The expected consumer behavior **must** be stated in the operator catalog entry for the toolchain version.

### Streaming time semantics

Watermarks, session windows, and stateful streaming operations are outside the scope of core Substrait's logical plan language:

- They **must** be expressed either through registered named extensions with explicitly documented semantics, or through a separate execution-level IR that is not the normative Substrait interchange.
- Any use of streaming extensions in the normative Substrait output **must** be documented as non-portable to non-streaming consumers.
- The operator catalog entry **must** state which consumers are known to handle the extension correctly.
