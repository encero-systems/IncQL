# IncQL architecture

This document describes the architectural model of **IncQL**. It is scoped to the IncQL repository and its relationship to the Incan compiler, not to product orchestration or engine-specific operational concerns.

## What IncQL is

IncQL is two things that evolve together:

1. **A specification** under [docs/rfcs/][incql-rfcs]: naming and core semantics, dataset carriers, Substrait emission, query authoring, the execution boundary, and the internal planning substrate.
2. **An Incan library package**: `.incn` modules built with `incan build --lib`, consumed by Incan programs as a typed relational package.

The Incan compiler remains responsible for parsing, typechecking, lowering, and Rust/code generation. The IncQL repo holds the author-facing package, its documentation, and the RFCs that define what that package is supposed to mean.

## Architectural model

IncQL is organized around three layers:

- **Prism internally** — the immutable planning and optimization engine over persistent authored plan state and derived optimized views
- **Substrait at the boundary** — the normative emitted logical interchange contract
- **Session for execution** — the execution and binding layer that consumes plans but does not define them

That gives each major concept one job:

- **Prism** thinks about the plan
- **Substrait** communicates the plan
- **Session** executes the plan

Per [RFC 008][rfc-008], that split is intentionally minimal at this stage:

- Prism owns logical plan shaping before execution
- Session owns backend binding, physical planning, runtime metrics, and adaptive behavior
- richer statistics transport and optimizer mechanics remain follow-on work

This separation keeps internal planning concerns, portable interchange semantics, and runtime execution concerns from collapsing into one another.

## Conceptual pipeline

IncQL follows this shape:

```text

        ▼

        │
        ├──► method chains

        Prism logical planning substrate
                 │
                 ├──► authored plan state
                 ├──► lineage-preserving optimization
                 └──► derived optimized views
                          │
                          ▼
                Substrait Plan / Rel emission
                          │
                          ▼
                  Session / backend execution
```

The core rule is:

- authoring surfaces build or manipulate Prism-managed logical work
- Prism prepares that work for boundary emission
- RFC 002 owns the Substrait contract
- RFC 004 owns execution and binding

## Layer responsibilities

### Carriers

The author-facing carrier family is rooted in `DataSet[T]` and includes `LazyFrame[T]`, `DataFrame[T]`, and `DataStream[T]`.

Carriers are expected to be:

- typed by model-derived schema information
- immutable from the author’s point of view
- cheap to branch
- execution-neutral on their own

They should be understood as experiences over planning state, not as independent semantic systems.

For current package behavior, see [Dataset carriers (Reference)][dataset-ref] and [Dataset carriers (Explanation)][dataset-expl].

### Prism

Per [RFC 007][rfc-007], Prism is IncQL’s internal logical planning and optimization engine.

Prism is responsible for:

- persistent authored logical plan storage
- cheap branching through structural sharing
- lineage preservation
- logical rewrites and derived optimized views before boundary emission or execution

Prism is not the normative interchange format and not the execution engine.

### Substrait

Per [RFC 002][rfc-002], Apache Substrait is the normative logical interchange boundary for IncQL.

That means:

- portable relational work must be expressible as Substrait `Plan` / `Rel`
- logical reads remain logical at the boundary
- extension and gap handling are documented at the Substrait boundary
- internal planning freedom is allowed, but emitted plans must follow RFC 002

Substrait-facing package code lives primarily under [`src/substrait/`][src-substrait]. The current implementation is intentionally split into focused modules for relation building, plan assembly, schema registry, extension bookkeeping, expression lowering, and inspection. For current boundary docs, start with [Substrait read-root and binding contract][substrait-read-root].

### Session

Per [RFC 004][rfc-004], `Session` owns binding and execution.

Session is responsible for:

- resolving logical reads to physical resources
- applying backend-specific execution behavior
- owning physical planning and runtime adaptation policy
- collecting or materializing results
- writing to sinks where appropriate

The public Session surface is sync-first for common author workflows, but the execution substrate underneath it remains async-capable. That keeps local and batch usage ergonomic without collapsing the backend seam into a permanently blocking design.

Session is intentionally outside RFC 002’s normative emitted contract. It consumes plans; it does not define plan semantics.

For current package behavior, see [Execution context (Reference)][execution-ref] and [Execution context (Explanation)][execution-expl].

## Package implementation shape

The package uses the following implementation shape:

- author-facing carrier types live in [`src/dataset/mod.incn`][src-dataset-mod]
- canonical relational operator helpers live in [`src/dataset/ops.incn`][src-dataset-ops]
- Substrait emission lives under [`src/substrait/`][src-substrait]
- Prism internals live under [`src/prism/`][src-prism]
- `LazyFrame[T]` routes through a backend-native `PrismCursor[T]`
- `DataFrame[T]` and `DataStream[T]` keep their carrier-specific backing shapes while sharing the public dataset surface

This keeps package architecture in this document while detailed API behavior lives in language docs and future surface expansion stays in RFCs, issues, and release notes.

## Repository layout

| `docs/release_notes/`                | Release-facing notes                               |

Normative behavior lives in the RFC series first. Current package behavior and usage belong in the language docs. If code and RFCs disagree, treat that as a bug or transition state to resolve explicitly.

## Repository vs compiler

The IncQL repository and the Incan compiler have different responsibilities.

```text

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│  Makes IncQL package code executable and supports language surfaces          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

That distinction matters because package design and compiler implementation move at different speeds. The repo owns the package and its design records; the compiler owns the language and tooling machinery that makes those surfaces executable.

## Build and test

From the repo root, with `incan` on `PATH`:

```text
incan build --lib
incan test tests
```

In practice:

- `incan build --lib` parses, typechecks, lowers, and emits a Rust crate for the IncQL library
- `incan test tests` discovers and runs package tests under `tests/`

CI builds `incan` first, then runs the IncQL package checks against that compiler.
