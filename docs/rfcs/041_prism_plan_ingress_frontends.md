## Summary

This RFC defines Prism plan ingress and external client frontends for IncQL. A frontend receives an external authoring or client protocol such as Spark Connect, SQL, or another unresolved relational plan surface, decodes it into a Prism-owned unresolved ingress plan, and asks Prism to analyze that plan into ordinary IncQL relational semantics. The frontend may preserve client-origin evidence, client-session evidence, protocol diagnostics, and ingress coverage records, but it must not make the external protocol, Spark, Substrait, DataFusion, or any backend adapter the semantic owner of the plan.

## Motivation

IncQL should be able to interoperate with established client APIs without pretending that those APIs own IncQL's semantics. Spark Connect is the clearest pressure: a PySpark client can submit plan-shaped calls over a protocol boundary, and those calls may depend on client session state such as configuration, current catalog, temporary views, or function aliases. IncQL should not route those calls through Spark just to recover meaning later. Prism should receive an unresolved representation, resolve names and functions, apply IncQL semantic rules under an explicit profile and session context, and then continue through the normal planning, evidence, Substrait, and execution paths.

Without a first-class ingress contract, external API support will be squeezed into session adapters, backend adapters, Substrait metadata, or compatibility flags. That would hide the real boundary. Execution adapters run plans. Plan ingress frontends receive external plan requests and let Prism create IncQL plans.

## Goals

- Define plan ingress frontends as distinct from execution session adapters.
- Define a Prism-owned unresolved ingress plan model for external client plans.
- Preserve client-origin evidence without treating external node identifiers as IncQL semantic identities.
- Represent client session state that can affect Prism analysis.
- Allow Spark Connect-style clients to submit supported relation, expression, and command calls that Prism analyzes directly.
- Require structured unsupported-feature diagnostics and ingress coverage records.
- Connect ingress analysis to semantic profiles for client protocol behavior such as case sensitivity, function aliases, coercion, temporal behavior, and null ordering.
- Keep DataFusion and other execution backends behind the existing execution adapter boundary.

## Non-Goals

- Defining full Spark API parity.
- Defining every Spark Connect protobuf message, gRPC service method, or streaming transport detail.
- Making Spark, PySpark, Spark Connect, DataFusion, or Substrait the source of IncQL relational meaning.
- Defining SQL transpilation as the internal planning model.
- Reimplementing every external client session lifecycle rule.
- Defining a hosted compatibility service or global conformance registry.
- Requiring every IncQL deployment to expose an external client protocol.

## Guide-level explanation (how authors think about it)

An external client frontend lets an existing tool submit relational intent while IncQL keeps Prism as the planner:

```incan
from pub::incql.frontends.spark import spark_connect_frontend
from pub::incql.session import datafusion_session

frontend = spark_connect_frontend(session_factory=datafusion_session)
frontend.serve("127.0.0.1:15002")
```

A PySpark client may send a supported Spark Connect plan to that endpoint. The frontend decodes the request into a Prism ingress plan, Prism analyzes it, and the selected IncQL session executes the resulting plan through the normal adapter path.

The important user model is not that IncQL becomes Spark internally. The model is that IncQL can speak a client protocol at the edge while keeping Prism responsible for names, functions, types, lineage, diagnostics, evidence, and execution requirements.

## Reference-level explanation (precise rules)

IncQL must define a plan ingress frontend boundary. A frontend may parse, decode, authenticate, route, frame client requests, and maintain client session state. It must not resolve relational semantics by delegating to an external engine when Prism can represent the requested plan.

An ingress frontend must produce a Prism-owned unresolved ingress plan or a structured unsupported diagnostic. An unresolved ingress plan must represent at least:

- ingress request identity
- ingress frontend identity
- client session identity when the request is session-scoped
- client protocol and protocol version when available
- requested semantic profile when available
- unresolved relation nodes
- unresolved expression nodes
- unresolved command nodes when the protocol includes commands
- client-origin references
- diagnostics
- ingress coverage records

Prism analysis of an ingress plan must produce ordinary Prism semantic targets, relation plans, expression plans, diagnostics, lineage inputs, adapter requirements, and inspection evidence. External client node identifiers may be preserved as origin references, but they must not replace Prism semantic target identities.

Client session state that can affect analysis must be represented as client session targets, typed attachments, profile evidence, or analyzer binding references. This includes current catalog or namespace, temporary relation names, session variables, function registrations, case sensitivity, ANSI or compatibility modes, timezone settings, and other frontend-specific state that changes name resolution, type coercion, function lookup, or expression semantics.

Analyzer bindings that depend on client session state must reference the relevant client session target or profile assessment. A later inspection should be able to explain that a relation, function, alias, identifier, or coercion resolved under a specific client session context without treating that client session as the source of relational meaning.

Ingress frontends must distinguish at least the following coverage states for protocol features:

- supported: Prism can represent and analyze the feature under the selected profile
- partially_supported: Prism can represent the feature only under recorded restrictions
- unsupported: Prism cannot represent or analyze the feature
- unknown: IncQL cannot determine support for the feature

Unsupported and unknown ingress features must be reported before execution when they affect plan semantics. They must not be silently lowered to backend-specific behavior.

Spark Connect compatibility must be modeled as a frontend protocol profile plus ingress coverage, not as a backend adapter capability alone. A Spark Connect frontend may accept supported relation and expression calls, reject unsupported calls, and report coverage for omitted protocol areas. It must not require Spark's engine to produce the semantic plan that Prism will execute.

Semantic profiles may affect ingress analysis. Profile dimensions may control identifier resolution, case sensitivity, function aliases, type coercion, null and NaN behavior, timestamp semantics, decimal behavior, ANSI mode, and other compatibility-sensitive rules. Profile evidence must be explicit when the frontend uses those rules.

Commands that do not describe relational computation, such as session configuration, catalog inspection, temporary view registration, cache control, or client lifecycle operations, must be represented as command ingress nodes, mapped to explicit IncQL client session or execution session behavior, or rejected with structured diagnostics. Accepted commands that mutate client session state must produce client session evidence. They must not be disguised as ordinary relational plan nodes.

Plan ingress evidence must be inspectable. Tools must be able to see which frontend produced a plan, which client session context affected analysis, which client protocol features were used, which features were unsupported or partially supported, which profile governed analysis, and how client-origin references map to Prism targets.

## Design details

### Syntax

This RFC introduces no IncQL authoring syntax. Frontends are package or service APIs around Prism and Session.

### Semantics

Plan ingress is a semantic boundary before Prism analysis. It is not an execution boundary. The frontend receives external input, Prism owns analysis, and Session plus execution adapters own execution.

The unresolved ingress model should be general enough for Spark Connect, SQL parsers, notebook clients, and future external plan protocols, but each frontend must declare its own protocol coverage, session-state model, and profile assumptions.

### Interaction with other IncQL surfaces

Method chains, `query {}` blocks, SQL frontends, and Spark Connect frontends may all produce Prism plans. Equivalent relational intent should converge on comparable Prism targets after analysis, subject to explicit profile differences.

Prism lineage must preserve client-origin relationships where available. Those relationships explain where a Prism target came from, but they are not value lineage by themselves.

Inspection APIs and artifacts must expose ingress diagnostics, origin mappings, selected profiles, relevant client session targets, and ingress coverage when a plan came through a frontend.

Adapter requirements and coverage remain execution-facing evidence. Ingress coverage is frontend-facing evidence. A Spark Connect relation node being accepted by a frontend is not the same as DataFusion being able to execute the resulting plan.

### Compatibility / migration

Existing IncQL plans and sessions remain valid without ingress evidence. Frontends are additive. Tools that require client-origin evidence must report missing ingress evidence as unsupported or unknown rather than inferring it from display names or backend plans.

## Alternatives considered

- **Use Spark as the planner.** Rejected because that would make Spark the semantic owner and reduce Prism to an execution bridge.
- **Translate Spark Connect directly to Substrait.** Rejected because Substrait is an interchange boundary, not the full IncQL semantic analysis and evidence model.
- **Treat Spark Connect support as a backend adapter.** Rejected because receiving client plan calls and executing an analyzed plan are different boundaries.
- **Only support IncQL-native authoring.** Rejected because external client protocols are valuable when they feed Prism honestly instead of bypassing it.
- **Accept unsupported calls and hope the backend handles them.** Rejected because unknown frontend semantics must be visible before execution.

## Drawbacks

- Frontends require protocol-specific maintenance.
- Spark compatibility pressure can pull non-portable semantics into the system unless profiles and coverage stay explicit.
- The unresolved ingress model adds another planning representation before Prism's analyzed plan.
- Early frontend support will be partial, which requires clear diagnostics and compatibility documentation.

## Layers affected

- **IncQL specification** — plan ingress, frontend coverage, origin mapping, and Prism analysis boundaries become normative vocabulary.
- **IncQL library package** — frontend APIs, unresolved ingress plan records, diagnostics, and inspection records must be exposed through public modules where implemented.
- **Execution / interchange** — Session and backend adapters execute Prism-owned plans and may report adapter coverage, but they do not own ingress semantics.
- **Documentation** — docs must distinguish external client protocol support from Spark engine compatibility, Substrait interchange, and DataFusion execution.

## Design Decisions

### Resolved

- The first implemented ingress analyzer supports a single-root, linear relation request: named-table read, filter, projection, group-by, aggregate, order-by, and limit. Those steps are enough to prove the frontend/Prism boundary without claiming full Spark Connect, SQL parser, join-tree, generator, or window API parity.
- The core package owns the shared ingress record model, evidence records, coverage states, and Prism analyzer entry point. Protocol services, transport framing, authentication, complete Spark Connect protobuf coverage, and provider-specific client lifecycle behavior belong in optional integration packages over that core record model.
- The common unresolved ingress model consists of request identity, frontend kind, protocol metadata, client session context, optional requested semantic profile, origin references, linear relation steps, command nodes, diagnostics, coverage records, and evidence references. SQL, Spark Connect, notebook, and API frontends can all project their first supported surfaces into that model without making their native protocol the semantic authority.
- The first client session context records session id, request id, frontend id, current catalog, current namespace, timezone, case sensitivity, ANSI mode, configuration fingerprint, and evidence references. This is deliberately a compact evidence context rather than a wholesale copy of any one external session model.
- Non-relational commands are represented but rejected by the core analyzer until an integration package maps them to explicit client-session behavior. Rejection is visible through diagnostics and unsupported ingress coverage, not hidden behind backend behavior.
