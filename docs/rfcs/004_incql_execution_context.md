## Summary

This RFC specifies the **execution context**: the session object that bridges IncQL's **typed logical plans** and **real execution**. It defines how authors **read data** into `DataSet[T]` values, **execute plans** (lowered to Substrait per IncQL RFC 002), and **write results** back to storage. **Apache DataFusion** is the **reference (and default) execution backend** for plan optimization and execution: it consumes Substrait plans, applies query optimizations (predicate pushdown, projection pruning, join reordering, constant folding), and executes against registered data sources, returning **Apache Arrow** record batches that IncQL wraps in typed `DataFrame[T]` carriers. This RFC standardizes the explicit core `Session` contract; higher operational layers may compose, scope, or inject sessions and adapter conveniences on top, but they do not redefine IncQL execution semantics. With RFCs 000–004, IncQL is usable for read → transform → write workflows.

## Core model

1. A **`Session`** (or **execution context**) is the entry point for IncQL programs that interact with data. It holds **table registrations**, **configuration**, and a **reference to the execution backend**.
2. **Reading data** creates `LazyFrame[T]` or `DataStream[T]` values from registered sources. The session resolves logical names to physical data; the plan carries only the logical identity (IncQL RFC 002).
3. **Executing plans** passes Substrait plans (or equivalent IR) through the backend's **optimizer** and **executor**, producing **Arrow record batches**.
4. **Materializing results** wraps Arrow output in typed `DataFrame[T]` carriers (IncQL RFC 001).
5. **Writing results** sends `DataSet[T]` values (or materialized `DataFrame[T]`) to registered output targets.

## Motivation

IncQL RFCs 000–003 define a typed query language that produces portable logical plans. Without an execution context, those plans are inert: there is no way to read data in, execute the relational work, or write results out. The execution context completes the pipeline from authored intent to running workload.

Choosing Apache DataFusion as the reference backend is a pragmatic decision: it is Rust-native, Substrait-aware, provides serious query optimization, and operates on Apache Arrow — the de facto columnar data interchange format in the modern data ecosystem. Naming it explicitly avoids the trap of an abstract "pluggable backend" with no concrete implementation.

The `Session` surface should also feel familiar to users coming from established data runtimes such as Spark: one obvious entry point for reading data, registering logical names, executing plans, and writing results. That familiarity is an ergonomic goal, but not a semantic dependency. IncQL keeps its own typed `DataSet[T]` model, explicit execution boundary, and RFC-defined semantics rather than inheriting runtime-specific API details from other systems.

## Goals

- Define **`Session`** as the execution context: what it holds, how authors create one, and what operations it exposes.
- Specify **read operations**: how named tables, files, and virtual data become `LazyFrame[T]` or `DataStream[T]` values through the session.
- Specify **plan execution**: how Substrait plans (IncQL RFC 002) flow through the backend optimizer and executor to produce results.
- Specify **materialization**: how execution output (Arrow record batches) becomes typed `DataFrame[T]` (IncQL RFC 001).
- Specify **write operations**: how `DataSet[T]` values are written to registered output targets.
- Name **Apache DataFusion** as the reference and default execution backend, with **Apache Arrow** as the in-memory data representation.
- Define the **backend abstraction** so alternative backends (Polars, DuckDB, remote engines) can be substituted without changing author code, with backend-specific configuration exposed through a dedicated `backends` namespace rather than the root API.
- Clarify the boundary between the execution backend and higher operational or adapter layers that may provide source/sink integrations or scoped session conveniences.
- Shape the `Session` surface as a familiar entry point for data work, taking ergonomic inspiration from established runtimes such as Spark while preserving IncQL's typed carrier model and explicit execution boundaries.

## Non-Goals

- Normative naming rules — IncQL RFC 000.
- Dataset types and trait hierarchy — IncQL RFC 001.
- Substrait `Rel`-level mapping and extension policy — IncQL RFC 002.
- `query {}` grammar and clause inventory — IncQL RFC 003.
- Orchestration, workflow scheduling, quality gates — execution and operational layers above IncQL.
- Distributed execution, cluster scheduling, shuffle — out of scope for IncQL; may be addressed by runners in the operational layer.
- Credential management, secret resolution, IAM — operational layer; the session receives resolved bindings, not raw secrets.
- Standardizing workflow-scoped session propagation, active-session lookup, or Reader/Writer convenience APIs — these may be provided by higher operational layers, but are not part of the core IncQL contract in this RFC.

## Guide-level explanation

### Creating a session

```incan
from pub::incql import Session

session = Session.default()
```

A session holds registered data sources and configuration. `Session.default()` creates a context with the default backend (DataFusion). Authors who need custom configuration use a builder; backend-specific configuration lives under `pub::incql.backends`. Higher operational layers may wrap this construction behind step- or pipeline-level runtime setup, but the core IncQL surface remains an explicit `Session`:

```incan
from pub::incql import Session, backends

session = Session.builder()
    .with_backend(backends.DataFusion())
    .build()
```

### Reading data

```incan
from pub::incql import Session, LazyFrame, csv_source
from models import Order

session = Session.default()

# Register a named table (logical name → physical source)
session.register("orders", csv_source("s3://bucket/orders.csv"))

# Create a lazy plan from the registered table
orders: LazyFrame[Order] = session.table("orders")
```

`session.table("orders")` returns a `LazyFrame[Order]` — a deferred plan rooted in a `ReadRel` (IncQL RFC 002) that carries the logical name `"orders"`. No data moves until the plan is executed.

For file-based sources:

```incan
from models import Event

events: LazyFrame[Event] = session.read_parquet("events", "s3://bucket/events/*.parquet")
```

For inline data:

```incan
sample: LazyFrame[Order] = session.from_values([
    Order(order_id="1", customer_id="c1", amount=100.0),
    Order(order_id="2", customer_id="c2", amount=250.0),
])
```

### Transforming data

Once you have a `LazyFrame[T]`, use `query {}` (IncQL RFC 003) or method chains (IncQL RFC 001):

```incan
from pub::incql.functions import count, sum

result = query {
    FROM orders
    WHERE .amount > 100
    GROUP BY .region
    SELECT
        region,
        count() as order_count,
        sum(.amount) as total_revenue,
    ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
}
```

### Executing and collecting

```incan
from pub::incql import DataFrame
from models import OrderSummary

# Execute the plan and materialize results
materialized: DataFrame[OrderSummary] = session.collect(result)
```

`session.collect(result)` takes the `LazyFrame`, lowers to Substrait (IncQL RFC 002), passes the plan through DataFusion's optimizer, executes it, and wraps the resulting Arrow record batches in a typed `DataFrame[T]`.

### Writing results

```incan
from pub::incql import parquet_sink

# Write to a registered output target
session.write(materialized, parquet_sink("s3://bucket/summaries/"))

# Or write a deferred plan through a file-format convenience helper
session.write_parquet(result, "s3://bucket/summaries/")
```

### End-to-end example

```incan
from pub::incql import Session, LazyFrame, DataFrame, csv_source, parquet_sink
from pub::incql.functions import count, sum
from models import Order, OrderSummary

session = Session.default()
session.register("orders", csv_source("s3://bucket/orders.csv"))

orders: LazyFrame[Order] = session.table("orders")

summary: LazyFrame[OrderSummary] = query {
    FROM orders
    WHERE .status == "completed"
    GROUP BY .region
    SELECT
        region,
        count() as order_count,
        sum(.amount) as total_revenue,
}

result: DataFrame[OrderSummary] = session.collect(summary)
session.write(result, parquet_sink("s3://bucket/summaries/"))
```

## Reference-level explanation

### `Session` object

- **`Session`** is the primary execution context. It **must** hold:
  - A **table registry**: logical names mapped to data source definitions.
  - A **backend reference**: the execution engine (DataFusion by default).
  - **Configuration**: optimizer settings, runtime parameters, and feature flags.
- `Session.default()` **must** create a context with the DataFusion backend and default configuration.
- `Session.builder()` **must** return a builder that allows backend selection and configuration before constructing the session.
- The `Session` API **should** present a small, discoverable entry-point surface for data work, broadly analogous to familiar runtime entry points in systems such as Spark.
- That ergonomic inspiration **must not** override IncQL's typed carrier model, explicit `Session.collect(...)` execution boundary, or the prohibition on raw SQL as a core execution path.

The intended core session surface for v0.1 is:

|               Method               |                                    Purpose                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Session.default()`                | Create a session with the default execution backend and default configuration |
| `Session.builder()`                | Create a builder for backend selection and configuration                      |
| `session.register(name, source)`   | Bind a logical relation name to a source definition                           |
| `session.table(name)`              | Resolve a registered logical relation as `LazyFrame[T]`                       |
| `session.read_parquet(uri)`        | Create a `LazyFrame[T]` from Parquet input                                    |

| `session.read_arrow(uri)`          | Create a `LazyFrame[T]` from Arrow IPC input                                  |
| `session.from_values(rows)`        | Create a `LazyFrame[T]` from inline typed values                              |
| `session.collect(data)`            | Execute a deferred plan and materialize `DataFrame[T]`                        |
| `session.write(data, target)`      | Write bounded data to a typed sink target                                     |
| `session.write_parquet(data, uri)` | Write bounded data to Parquet output                                          |
| `session.write_csv(data, uri)`     | Write bounded data to CSV output                                              |

This table defines the intended high-level API shape. The detailed normative rules for reading, registration, execution, and writing are specified in the sections below.

### Read operations

|           Method            |    Returns     |        Substrait lowering (IncQL RFC 002)         |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `session.table(name)`       | `LazyFrame[T]` | `ReadRel` + `NamedTable`                         |
| `session.read_parquet(uri)` | `LazyFrame[T]` | `ReadRel` + `LocalFiles` (Parquet format)        |
| `session.read_csv(uri)`     | `LazyFrame[T]` | `ReadRel` + `LocalFiles` (delimited text format) |
| `session.read_arrow(uri)`   | `LazyFrame[T]` | `ReadRel` + `LocalFiles` (Arrow IPC format)      |
| `session.from_values(rows)` | `LazyFrame[T]` | `ReadRel` + `VirtualTable`                       |

- Read operations **must** return `LazyFrame[T]` — no data is fetched until the plan is executed.
- The schema parameter `T` **must** be inferred from the registered table definition, from the file schema, or from the literal values provided.
- `session.table(name)` **must** resolve `name` through the session's table registry. If the name is not registered, it **must** produce a compile-time or registration-time error.

### Table registration

- `session.register(logical_name, source_identifier)` binds a logical name to a data source definition.
- The `source_identifier` is an opaque string or structured descriptor that the session resolves through its integration and execution layers to a concrete scan. IncQL does not define the format of source identifiers beyond requiring that the session can resolve them for the chosen execution backend.
- Registration **may** also accept explicit schema information (an Incan `model` type) for sources where the schema cannot be inferred.

### Plan execution

- `session.collect(lazy_frame)` **must**:
  1. Lower the `LazyFrame`'s logical plan to Substrait (conforming to IncQL RFC 002).
  2. Pass the Substrait plan to the backend for optimization and execution.
  3. Wrap the resulting data in a typed `DataFrame[T]` (IncQL RFC 001).
- `Session.collect(...)` is the canonical execution entry point in the normative API. Implementations **may** additionally offer a convenience form on `LazyFrame`, but it **must** delegate to session-owned execution semantics rather than bypassing the session boundary.
- The backend **should** apply query optimizations (predicate pushdown, projection pruning, join reordering, constant folding, common-subexpression elimination) before execution.
- Execution and write methods **must** report typed failures that distinguish at least registration / binding errors, lowering or planning errors, backend optimization or execution errors, and I/O or sink errors.

### Write operations

|               Method               |        Input        |              Description              |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `session.write(data, target)`      | `BoundedDataSet[T]` | Write to a typed sink target          |
| `session.write_parquet(data, uri)` | `LazyFrame[T]`      | Convenience form for Parquet files    |
| `session.write_csv(data, uri)`     | `LazyFrame[T]`      | Convenience form for CSV files        |

- Write operations **must** execute the plan if the input is a `LazyFrame[T]` (deferred), then write the materialized data.
- `session.write(data, target)` accepts a typed sink descriptor such as `csv_sink(uri)` or `parquet_sink(uri)`. It must not infer format from filename text alone.
- File-format convenience methods **may** accept only deferred bounded plans when the generic `session.write(data, target)` API covers the broader `BoundedDataSet[T]` surface.
- Write to streaming sinks (when supported) **may** accept `UnboundedDataSet[T]`.

### DataFusion as reference backend

Apache DataFusion is the **reference and default** execution backend for IncQL v0.1:

- **Plan consumption**: DataFusion accepts Substrait plans through the `substrait` crate's consumer, converting them to DataFusion logical plans.
- **Optimization**: DataFusion's optimizer applies rule-based and cost-based optimizations to the logical plan before execution.
- **Execution**: DataFusion executes the optimized plan against registered table providers, producing Apache Arrow `RecordBatch` results.
- **Arrow as data plane**: DataFusion operates natively on Arrow columnar data. IncQL's `DataFrame[T]` wraps Arrow record batches with the typed model `T` on top.

The data flow:

```text
IncQL query / method chain
  → Substrait Plan (protobuf, IncQL RFC 002)
  → DataFusion LogicalPlan (via substrait consumer)
  → DataFusion optimizer
  → DataFusion physical execution
  → Arrow RecordBatch[]
  → DataFrame[T] (typed IncQL carrier, IncQL RFC 001)
```

### Backend abstraction

- The `Session` **must** abstract over the execution backend so that alternative implementations (Polars, DuckDB, remote engines, future custom backends) can be substituted without changing author code.
- A single `Session` owns one execution backend for a given execution boundary.
- The backend interface **must** support at minimum: plan execution from Substrait, table provider registration, and result collection as Arrow record batches (or equivalent).
- DataFusion is the **default**; it is not the **only** permitted backend. Implementations **may** offer backend selection through `Session.builder()`.
- `Session.builder()` **must** expose a stable portable configuration subset (at minimum backend selection plus core execution and optimizer settings). Backend-specific tuning **may** be surfaced through backend options, but this RFC does not standardize the full DataFusion configuration surface.
- Backend-specific configuration objects **should** be exposed from `pub::incql.backends` rather than from the root `pub::incql` namespace.
- The normative user-facing session type remains `Session`; this RFC does not define backend-named session types such as `DuckDbSession` or `PolarsSession`.
- External systems such as warehouses, databases, filesystems, or object stores are not necessarily execution backends. They **may** instead appear as sources or sinks resolved through the session's integration layer while plan execution remains owned by the session's selected backend.
- Higher operational layers **may** provide scoped session propagation or convenience APIs for adapters and workflow steps, but those conveniences **must** delegate to `Session` rather than replacing the core execution model defined here.

### Interaction with IncQL RFC 001 types

- `session.table(name)` returns `LazyFrame[T]` — a `BoundedDataSet[T]`.
- `session.collect(plan)` returns `DataFrame[T]` — a materialized `BoundedDataSet[T]`.
- Streaming sources (when supported) return `DataStream[T]` — an `UnboundedDataSet[T]`.
- The session **must** preserve type parameter `T` through the full read → transform → collect → write cycle.

## Design details

### Interaction with Incan

- The session is an Incan value — it can be passed, stored, and used in ordinary Incan code.
- `model` definitions supply schema for `T` as in all other IncQL RFCs.

### Interaction with operational layers

- Operational layers **may** construct, scope, and inject `Session` values for steps, jobs, or pipeline runs.
- Such layers **may** offer convenience APIs on readers, writers, or workflow steps that rely on a locally scoped session, but those APIs are layered sugar over the `Session` contract rather than alternate execution semantics.
- IncQL itself continues to define the session, backend selection, registration, execution, and write boundary.

### Compatibility

- New read/write formats and backend options **should** be additive.
- The `Session` API surface is expected to grow; breaking changes **must** go through a deprecation path.

## Alternatives considered

- **No session / implicit context in core IncQL** (Polars-style) — rejected; an explicit session makes backend selection, table registration, and configuration visible rather than ambient. It also maps cleanly to DataFusion's `SessionContext`. Higher operational layers may still provide scoped convenience on top of that explicit core.
- **Session defined in the operational layer only** — rejected; without a session in IncQL itself, there is no way to write self-contained IncQL programs that read, transform, and write data. The operational layer may compose sessions with workflow and adapter concerns, but the base concept belongs in IncQL.
- **Abstract backend only, no named reference** — rejected; naming DataFusion as the reference avoids an abstract interface with no concrete implementation. The abstraction exists for extensibility; DataFusion is what ships.

## Drawbacks

- Coupling to DataFusion (even as "reference") creates an implicit dependency on DataFusion's Substrait consumer maturity and feature coverage.
- The session concept adds API surface beyond pure query semantics.
- Arrow as the data plane is an implementation choice that leaks through `DataFrame[T]`'s runtime representation.

## Implementation architecture

Non-normative: the reference implementation **should** use DataFusion's `SessionContext` as the underlying engine, with IncQL's `Session` wrapping it to provide typed APIs, table registration helpers, and Substrait plan submission. The Substrait-to-DataFusion path **should** use the community `substrait` crate (or equivalent).

## Layers affected

- **IncQL library**: `Session` type, read/write methods, `backends` module, backend abstraction trait.
- **Rust interop / FFI**: DataFusion integration, Arrow record batch handling.
- **Typechecker**: ensuring `T` flows correctly through session methods.
- **Testing**: end-to-end tests that read, transform, and write using the session.

## Design Decisions

- **Raw SQL escape hatch:** raw SQL execution is not part of IncQL and is not permitted as a `Session` escape hatch. SQL belongs in dialect-specific surfaces outside this RFC; it must not be smuggled through the execution-context API as an alternate query path.
- **External catalogs:** v0.1 standardizes logical registration and backend-resolved reads, not a portable catalog API. Integrations with systems such as Unity Catalog, Hive Metastore, or Iceberg REST **may** be supported by a backend or product layer, but their APIs and binding contracts are deferred from this RFC.
- **Collection API shape:** `Session.collect(...)` is the required canonical API. A convenience form on `LazyFrame` **may** exist, but it is secondary and must route through the session.
- **Error model:** execution-facing APIs **must** use typed errors that distinguish at least registration or binding failures, Substrait lowering or planning failures, backend optimization or runtime execution failures, and output or I/O failures. Exact type names are implementation details.
- **Builder configuration surface:** `Session.builder()` exposes a small portable configuration surface in v0.1. It **must not** promise one-to-one access to every DataFusion knob. Backend-specific configuration may be carried through backend options without becoming part of the portable IncQL contract.
- **Backend namespace and session shape:** backend-specific configuration belongs under `pub::incql.backends`, while `Session` remains the portable execution entry point. This RFC does not standardize backend-specific session types.
- **Execution backend vs source/sink integrations:** the backend named in `Session` is the engine that optimizes and executes the plan. External systems used for reads or writes may be integrated through registration or adapter layers without becoming separate execution backends in the core model.
- **Scoped session conveniences:** workflow or adapter layers may offer locally scoped session access as ergonomic sugar, but the normative IncQL contract remains the explicit `Session` API defined in this RFC.
- **Session API inspiration:** the `Session` surface intentionally takes ergonomic inspiration from familiar data-runtime entry points such as Spark's session object, but IncQL keeps its own typed carrier semantics, backend abstraction, and explicit execution model. Familiarity is a usability goal, not a promise of Spark API or semantic compatibility.

## Implementation plan and checklist (non-normative)

This section tracks the implementation path for this RFC. It is intentionally operational and does not change the normative semantics above.

### Plan

1. Land core `Session` surface and DataFusion-backed execution boundary.
2. Land materialization boundary (`collect`) and typed `DataFrame[T]` payload contract.
3. Land sink writes (`write_csv`, `write_parquet`) from deferred and materialized carriers.
4. Keep backend abstraction portable while shipping only DataFusion as the implemented backend.
5. Close remaining API gaps required by this RFC before marking status as `Implemented`.

### Checklist

- [x] `Session.default()` and `Session.builder()` exist.
- [x] DataFusion is wired as the reference/default backend.
- [x] Read paths exist for `table`, `read_csv`, `read_parquet`, and `read_arrow`.
- [x] `Session.execute(...)` exists as explicit execution checkpoint.
- [x] `Session.collect(...)` materializes `DataFrame[T]`.
- [x] `LazyFrame.collect()` convenience delegates through active-session/session-owned semantics.
- [x] `Session.write_csv(...)` and `Session.write_parquet(...)` exist.
- [x] Typed execution/write errors are surfaced across registration, planning, runtime, and sink failures.
- [ ] Logical-name schema binding is formalized as an explicit catalog/snapshot model rather than an implicit global registry, with clear overwrite diagnostics for collisions.
- [ ] Public dataset join typing is aligned with the intended DX for heterogeneous joins, including a real output-schema contract rather than a temporary `Self`-only surface.
- [ ] `Session.from_values(...)` is implemented as part of the core `Session` API surface described in this RFC.
- [x] Generic `Session.write(data, target)` API is implemented for the current typed sink descriptors (beyond file-specific sink methods).
- [ ] ~~Multi-backend implementation beyond DataFusion is shipped through the backend abstraction.~~ Moved out of this RFC's exit criteria; see the note below.

### Exit criteria for RFC status change

RFC 004 can move from `In Progress` to `Implemented` when all remaining checklist items above are complete and the IncQL CI gate is green on the target release branch.

**A second execution backend is no longer an exit criterion.** The portable backend abstraction is the requirement this RFC owns, and it is satisfied: Session dispatch routes through an adapter boundary over Substrait plans rather than wiring DataFusion into Session state. Shipping a second adapter proves the boundary but does not change the contract, and a second engine that reads the same local sources would give a user nothing they could observe.

What users actually lack is not another engine but real sources — object storage, partitioned datasets, and lakehouse table formats. That work is tracked under IncQL #112 and IncQL RFC 069, and it exercises the same adapter boundary more meaningfully than a duplicate runtime would.

A second backend remains desirable and stays tracked under IncQL #22. It is deliberately not a gate on this RFC.
