## Summary

This RFC defines the portable approximate aggregate boundary for IncQL and records the sketch-state policy decision. IncQL exposes explicit approximate aggregates for distinct counts and percentiles. It delegates sketch-state construction, merge, estimate, serialization, and deserialization helpers to IncQL RFC 025 because those helpers require typed sketch logical values rather than ordinary string or binary payloads.

## Motivation

Spark exposes many approximate and sketch functions because large-scale analytics often trades exactness for bounded memory or faster execution. IncQL should support the portable part of that direction, but sketch functions require more than names: they need accuracy parameters, merge semantics, serialization formats, determinism rules, and typed opaque state values.

If sketches are added as ordinary functions returning untyped bytes, IncQL will not be able to reason about compatibility, aggregation state, or cross-backend behavior.

## Goals

- Define approximate aggregates as distinct from exact aggregates.
- Implement portable `approx_count_distinct` and `approx_percentile` aggregate helpers.
- Require accuracy/error parameters to be part of function signatures when a portable helper supports them.
- Preserve IncQL-owned Substrait extension names and keep backend implementation names at the adapter boundary.
- Reserve sketch-state function names for IncQL RFC 025, where sketch state is modeled as an explicit typed value family.

## Non-Goals

- Making approximate functions part of the exact core aggregate contract.
- Exposing sketch state as string or binary payloads instead of the typed sketch logical values defined by IncQL RFC 025.
- Guaranteeing bit-for-bit compatibility with Spark or any other engine.
- Defining geospatial, cryptographic, or physical execution metadata functions.

## Guide-level explanation (how authors think about it)

Authors should see approximate functions as explicit approximate choices:

```incan
from pub::incql.functions import approx_count_distinct, approx_percentile, col

summary = (
    events
        .group_by([col("campaign_id")])
        .agg([
            approx_count_distinct(col("user_id")),
            approx_percentile(col("latency_ms"), 0.95, accuracy=10000),
        ])
)
```

The function names and arguments should make it clear that results are approximate and parameterized.

## Reference-level explanation (precise rules)

Approximate aggregate functions must be registered as approximate. Their registry entries must declare accuracy parameters, deterministic behavior for fixed inputs and parameters, mergeability, and result interpretation.

`approx_count_distinct(expr)` returns an approximate cardinality estimate over non-null expression values. It is a HyperLogLog-family aggregate. The portable helper intentionally has no relative-error parameter because the registered IncQL Substrait extension mapping is unary; backend-specific precision controls must not be smuggled into the portable helper contract.

`approx_percentile(expr, percentile, accuracy=10000)` returns an approximate percentile estimate over numeric non-null expression values. `percentile` is a literal fraction in the inclusive range `[0.0, 1.0]`. `accuracy` is a positive integer approximation hint carried as a normal aggregate argument. The portable contract is an approximate percentile estimate, not a bit-for-bit promise of one backend's interpolation or sketch representation.

Sketch-construction functions are reserved for IncQL RFC 025 and are not lowerable in this RFC. When they are introduced, they must return typed sketch values, not untyped binary blobs. Sketch values may have opaque runtime representation, but their logical type must identify the sketch family and value domain.

Sketch union, intersection, estimation, serialization, and deserialization functions are likewise reserved until IncQL can accept only compatible sketch types and reject incompatible sketch-family or value-domain combinations before execution.

If serialized sketch formats are exposed, format versioning and cross-version compatibility must be specified.

## Design details

### Syntax

This RFC permits ordinary function-call syntax for approximate aggregate functions. Reserved sketch helpers will use the same call style if IncQL RFC 025 admits them. RFC 023 does not require special query syntax.

### Semantics

Approximate functions must be opt-in by name or explicit option. IncQL must not silently replace an exact aggregate with an approximate aggregate because a backend prefers it.

Sketch merge functions must define whether they are associative, commutative, idempotent, or order-sensitive.

### Interaction with other IncQL surfaces

Approximate aggregates may appear anywhere aggregate measures are valid if their registry entry supports the position. Sketch scalar helpers are not exposed until sketch expressions have typed logical values.

### Compatibility / migration

This RFC is additive. Existing exact aggregates must not change semantics when approximate functions are introduced.

## Alternatives considered

- **Treat sketches as binary values.** Rejected because it loses type safety and merge compatibility.
- **Expose Spark sketch names directly as core functions.** Rejected because many sketch families are specialist extensions and require explicit state contracts.
- **Let backends choose approximate execution for exact aggregates.** Rejected because approximate results must be an author-visible choice.

## Drawbacks

- Sketch state types add complexity to the type system and serialization story.
- Cross-backend compatibility may be limited even when function names match.
- Accuracy parameters are difficult to explain without overpromising guarantees.

## Layers affected

- **IncQL specification** — approximate and sketch functions must be separate from exact aggregate semantics.
- **IncQL library package** — public helpers should expose approximate aggregate and sketch-state types only when contracts are explicit.
- **Incan compiler** — typechecking must validate sketch family compatibility and aggregate positions.
- **Execution / interchange** — Prism and Substrait lowering must preserve approximate parameters, sketch state types, and merge semantics or reject unsupported functions.
- **Documentation** — docs must label approximate functions clearly and explain accuracy parameters.

## Design Decisions

### Resolved

- `approx_count_distinct(expr)` is an aggregate measure, not a scalar expression, and its helper name makes approximate execution an explicit author choice.
- `approx_count_distinct` is registered as approximate metadata with HyperLogLog-family semantics, mergeability, and an approximate cardinality-result interpretation.
- `approx_count_distinct` follows IncQL's registered unary Substrait extension mapping. It does not expose a user-tunable relative-error parameter because the portable mapping does not carry one.
- `approx_percentile(expr, percentile, accuracy=10000)` is an aggregate measure with t-digest-family approximation metadata. The helper validates literal percentile and accuracy arguments before building the measure.
- `approx_percentile` output names include both percentile and accuracy parameters, so multiple percentile estimates over the same input expression remain distinct through Prism and Substrait inspection.
- DataFusion's implementation is named `approx_distinct`; IncQL keeps the IncQL Substrait function name in emitted function metadata and rewrites only the DataFusion consumer declaration at the backend adapter boundary.
- DataFusion's approximate percentile implementation is named `approx_percentile_cont`; IncQL uses the same adapter-only declaration rewrite and keeps `approx_percentile` as the portable Substrait extension name.
- `approx_count_distinct` allows aggregate-local filters and rejects an extra `distinct()` modifier because distinct estimation is already the helper's semantics.
- `approx_percentile` allows aggregate-local filters and rejects `distinct()` and ordered input because those modifiers are not part of the portable percentile aggregate contract.
- Sketch-state construction, merge, estimate, serialization, and deserialization helpers are delegated to IncQL RFC 025. They are not exposed as lowerable RFC 023 functions because exposing those helpers as ordinary strings or binary values would violate the compatibility rules this RFC is meant to protect.

### Remaining

- IncQL RFC 025 defines the follow-up design space for typed sketch state, portable serialization formats, and named merge/estimate helpers. That work must not retrofit RFC 023 by treating untyped binary payloads as sketch values.
- A future backend-capability layer may expose backend-specific approximation knobs as engine-specific functions or options when they cannot be represented by the portable helper signatures.

## Implementation Plan

1. Add registry approximation metadata with exact-helper defaults.
2. Add `approx_count_distinct(expr)` and `approx_percentile(expr, percentile, accuracy=10000)` under a logical approximate function family.
3. Add stable Substrait anchors and keep emitted function metadata on IncQL extension names.
4. Add DataFusion adapter-local declaration rewrites to the first backend's implementation names.
5. Add focused helper, registry, Substrait lowering, Prism, and DataFusion-backed session tests with materialized output.
6. Add user-facing approximate-function docs, aggregate-builder docs, and release notes.
7. Record sketch-state helper names as reserved for IncQL RFC 025.
