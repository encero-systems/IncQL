## Summary

This RFC defines IncQL functions for nested scalar values: arrays, maps, and structs. It covers construction, element access, cardinality, containment, overlap checks, sorting, set-like array operations, scalar array flattening, map entry access, and higher-order collection functions as a later extension point. Nested functions remain scalar when they produce one value per input row; cardinality-changing operations such as `explode` belong to a separate generator RFC.

## Motivation

Modern dataframe and warehouse systems routinely handle nested data. Spark has a large array/map/struct catalog, Snowflake has ARRAY/OBJECT/MAP and semi-structured VARIANT-oriented functions, Arrow and DataFusion support nested physical types, and Beam schemas support nested rows and collections. IncQL needs nested data functions for realistic semi-structured data without confusing scalar nested values with relation-shaping generators.

The split matters. `array_contains(.items, "x")` is a row-level scalar predicate. `explode(.items)` changes the number of rows and must be modeled differently.

## Goals

- Define scalar functions for arrays, maps, and structs.
- Distinguish nested scalar operations from generators.
- Define element access with an explicit one-based indexing policy.
- Define collection size, containment, sorting, and set-like operations.
- Leave lambda-based higher-order functions as a later design decision unless the host language surface is ready.

## Non-Goals

- Defining `explode`, `posexplode`, `inline`, or other cardinality-changing functions.
- Defining JSON, CSV, XML, or variant value parsing.
- Defining geospatial or sketch collection types.
- Defining a full lambda syntax for collection transforms.

## Guide-level explanation (how authors think about it)

Authors can inspect and manipulate nested values without changing relation cardinality:

```incan
from pub::incql.functions import array_contains, cardinality, col, element_at, lit, map_keys

enriched = (
    events
        .filter(array_contains(col("tags"), lit("purchase")))
        .with_column("tag_count", cardinality(col("tags")))
        .with_column("first_item", element_at(col("items"), lit(1)))
        .with_column("metadata_keys", map_keys(col("metadata")))
)
```

If an author wants one output row per item, that is a generator/table-valued operation rather than a nested scalar function.

## Reference-level explanation (precise rules)

IncQL defines array construction with `array`, struct construction with `named_struct`, and map construction with `map_from_arrays`.

IncQL defines `cardinality` as the canonical size function for arrays and maps. Compatibility aliases such as `size`, `array_size`, and `array_length` may resolve to `cardinality` where semantics match, but the initial implemented surface keeps the canonical spelling.

IncQL defines array element access with `element_at(array_expr, index)`. Indexes are one-based. Current lowering maps to the portable array-element adapter path and uses the backend adapter's recoverable out-of-range behavior until IncQL has a richer static/runtime error-policy split for strict versus try-style element access.

IncQL defines array predicates and transforms including `array_contains`, `array_position`, `array_sort`, `array_distinct`, `array_except`, `array_intersect`, `array_union`, `array_join`, `arrays_overlap`, `array_flatten`, `array_slice`, and `array_reverse` where type and null semantics are specified by the registry and backend adapter boundary. The scalar array-flattening helper is named `array_flatten` so table-valued or generator `flatten` remains available for RFC 021.

IncQL defines map functions including `map_contains_key`, `map_entries`, `map_extract`, `map_from_arrays`, `map_keys`, and `map_values`.

Object-style warehouse functions such as `object_construct`, `object_construct_keep_null`, `object_delete`, `object_insert`, `object_keys`, and `object_pick` are accounted for as semi-structured and dynamic-object concerns. They should be modeled through typed object/map semantics where possible and through the RFC 022 semi-structured family only when dynamic value semantics are required.

Higher-order functions such as `transform`, `filter`, `exists`, `forall`, `aggregate`, `reduce`, `zip_with`, `map_filter`, `transform_keys`, and `transform_values` must not reach Planned status until lambda or equivalent callback semantics are specified for IncQL expressions.

## Design details

### Syntax

This RFC requires importable function forms. Literal syntax for arrays, maps, or structs may be defined by another RFC and must lower to these semantic concepts where applicable.

### Semantics

Nested scalar functions produce one value per input row. A function that changes row count, expands fields into multiple columns, or returns a relation belongs to IncQL RFC 021.

Index origin, invalid-index behavior, null container behavior, null element behavior, and duplicate-map-key behavior must be specified before the corresponding functions reach Planned status.

### Interaction with other IncQL surfaces

Nested functions may appear wherever scalar expressions of their result type are valid. Grouping by nested values is not documented as portable until equality and ordering semantics for nested values are fully specified.

### Compatibility / migration

No current IncQL APIs are expected to break. Nested functions should be additive and gated by type support.

## Alternatives considered

- **Bundle nested functions with JSON or VARIANT functions.** Rejected because typed arrays/maps/structs are a core data model feature, while JSON parsing and dynamic variant values are format/value concerns.
- **Treat every collection operation as a generator.** Rejected because many collection operations are scalar row-level operations.
- **Add higher-order functions immediately.** Rejected until expression-lambda semantics are clear.

## Drawbacks

- Nested types require more precise type and nullability tracking.
- Backend support can differ sharply for nested operations.
- Index origin and invalid-access policy can surprise authors if aliases from different ecosystems are mixed carelessly.

## Layers affected

- **IncQL specification** — nested scalar functions must fit the scalar expression model without changing relation cardinality.
- **IncQL library package** — public helpers should expose nested constructors, accessors, and predicates.
- **Incan compiler** — typechecking must understand nested collection, map, and struct result types where functions are used.
- **Execution / interchange** — Prism and Substrait lowering must preserve nested value semantics or diagnose unsupported operations.
- **Documentation** — docs should separate nested scalar operations from generator functions.

## Design Decisions

### Resolved

- Element access, array position results, and array slice boundaries are one-based for SQL/Spark compatibility.
- `element_at(...)` uses the current adapter's recoverable array-element behavior for out-of-range indexes. A separate strict/try split is deferred until registry error policy can distinguish static validation failures from runtime recoverable results.
- Grouping and ordering over arrays, maps, and structs are not documented as portable in the initial implementation.
- Scalar `array_flatten(...)` is separate from RFC 021 table-valued or generator flattening.
- Higher-order collection functions remain deferred until IncQL expression callback or lambda semantics are specified.
