## Summary

This RFC defines IncQL's semi-structured and format-oriented function families: JSON value functions, CSV value functions, schema inference helpers, URL helpers, and hashing functions. These functions are practical data-engineering tools, but they should live in explicit format families rather than the core scalar catalog. Semi-structured variant values and their type predicates are defined separately by IncQL RFC 026.

## Motivation

Real data pipelines frequently parse JSON strings, emit JSON values, inspect CSV-shaped payloads, hash identifiers, and normalize URLs. Spark and Snowflake expose many of these as functions, while IncQL already has separate source-format RFCs. The design should preserve that boundary: reading a CSV file is an I/O concern, but parsing a CSV-encoded scalar value is a scalar format function.

Without a separate RFC, format helpers risk leaking ingestion policy into the scalar catalog or duplicating schema inference semantics from the session/source-discovery layer.

## Goals

- Define JSON scalar and schema helper functions.
- Define CSV scalar and schema helper functions.
- Keep string-backed format helpers compatible with the variant value model defined by IncQL RFC 026.
- Define URL parse/encode/decode helpers.
- Define deterministic hash functions for data engineering.
- Keep format functions separate from source reading and writing contracts.

## Non-Goals

- Defining source discovery, file scanning, or format handler registration.
- Defining XML, geospatial, crypto, or sketch functions.
- Defining semi-structured variant logical values or variant predicates; see IncQL RFC 026.
- Defining nested array/map/struct functions except as return values of parsing functions.
- Defining physical input-file metadata functions.

## Guide-level explanation (how authors think about it)

Authors should be able to parse and produce semi-structured scalar values inside relational transformations:

```incan
from pub::incql.functions import col, from_json, get_json_object, sha2, to_json

model EventPayload:
    type_ as "type": str

events = (
    raw_events
        .with_column("payload_obj", from_json[EventPayload](col("payload")))
        .with_column("event_type", get_json_object(col("payload"), "$.type"))
        .with_column("user_hash", sha2(col("user_id"), 256))
        .with_column("payload_out", to_json(col("payload_obj")))
)
```

Reading a JSON file into a dataset remains a session/source operation, not a scalar function call.

## Reference-level explanation (precise rules)

IncQL should define JSON functions including `from_json`, `to_json`, `get_json_object`, `json_array_length`, `json_object_keys`, `schema_of_json`, `parse_json`, `check_json`, `json_extract_path_text`, and `try_from_json` where recoverable parse behavior is desired. Explicit-schema JSON helpers derive schema descriptions from Incan model type parameters.

IncQL should define CSV value functions including `from_csv`, `to_csv`, and `schema_of_csv` only insofar as they operate on scalar values or schema descriptions. `from_csv[Model](...)` returns a logical map keyed by fields from the supplied Incan model type. These functions must not replace the session CSV read/write contract.

IncQL should define URL functions including `parse_url`, `url_encode`, `url_decode`, and `try_url_decode`, with exact invalid-input behavior recorded in the registry. `parse_url` extracts query parameter values by key.

IncQL should define hash functions including `crc32`, `md5`, `sha1`, `sha2`, and `xxhash64`, with input encoding and output representation specified.

IncQL RFC 026 defines semi-structured variant logical values and their type inspection predicates. Parser helpers in this RFC return validated, normalized payload text. RFC 026 must not silently change the meaning of the RFC 022 string-backed payload helpers.

Schema inference helper functions must be deterministic for the same input values and options. They must not inspect external files or session state unless explicitly defined as source-discovery functions outside this RFC.

## Design details

### Syntax

This RFC requires importable function forms. Format options may be positional, named, or option-record values, but their type and defaults must be specified before functions reach Planned status.

### Semantics

Strict parsing functions must fail on invalid input according to their registry error behavior. `try_` parsing functions must return null or another explicitly specified recoverable result on invalid input.

Hash functions must define whether they operate on UTF-8 string bytes, binary bytes, or typed value encodings. A hash over a typed value must not silently change encoding by backend.

### Interaction with other IncQL surfaces

Format scalar functions may be used anywhere scalar expressions of their result type are valid. Source reading and writing remain governed by the session and format handler RFCs.

### Compatibility / migration

This RFC is additive. It should not change existing CSV ingestion behavior.

## Alternatives considered

- **Place all format helpers in the common scalar catalog.** Rejected because format parsing has option, schema, and I/O-adjacent concerns that deserve a separate boundary.
- **Make JSON and CSV functions source-only.** Rejected because scalar payload parsing is common inside already-loaded datasets.
- **Add full XML and variant support in the same RFC.** Rejected because XML and semi-structured variant values need their own type and compatibility discussion. IncQL RFC 026 owns the variant value model.

## Drawbacks

- Format functions can blur the line between scalar transformation and ingestion if docs are weak.
- Schema inference helpers can be expensive or misleading on small samples.
- Hash output compatibility requires careful encoding rules.

## Layers affected

- **IncQL specification** — format functions must stay distinct from source and sink contracts.
- **IncQL library package** — public helpers should expose JSON, CSV scalar, URL, and hash functions with explicit scalar argument contracts.
- **Incan compiler** — typechecking must validate current scalar argument shapes; no new compiler syntax is required by this RFC.
- **Execution / interchange** — Prism and Substrait lowering must preserve parser options, hash encodings, and scalar payload contracts or diagnose unsupported functions.
- **Documentation** — docs should distinguish scalar format functions from session read/write APIs.

## Design Decisions

### Resolved

- Hash helpers operate on UTF-8 string bytes and return lowercase hexadecimal strings.
- Portable concrete hash helpers are `md5`, `sha1`, `sha224`, `sha256`, `sha384`, `sha512`, `crc32`, and `xxhash64`, each with an honest Substrait extension mapping. The DataFusion adapter validates materialized execution for the full helper set, using native DataFusion functions where available and Incan-authored adapter callbacks where DataFusion has no built-in implementation.
- `sha2(expr, bit_length)` is a compatibility helper, not a separate backend mapping. It rewrites to `sha224`, `sha256`, `sha384`, or `sha512` for supported literal bit lengths and rejects unsupported values.
- URL helpers accept scalar URL or component strings. `parse_url(...)` returns the first query parameter value for a literal key. `url_decode(...)` is strict and fails malformed percent escapes; `try_url_decode(...)` returns null for malformed percent escapes.
- JSON helpers accept scalar JSON payload strings. Strict helpers fail invalid JSON; `try_from_json[Model](...)` returns null for invalid JSON; schema and path helpers are deterministic over the provided payload, model type parameter, and literal path arguments.
- CSV helpers accept scalar row strings and explicit Incan model type parameters. Parsed CSV rows are logical maps rather than JSON text. They operate on payload values only and do not replace the session CSV read/write contract.
- Semi-structured variant predicates such as `typeof`, `is_array`, `is_object`, `is_integer`, `is_timestamp`, and `is_null_value` belong to IncQL RFC 026. RFC 022 does not accept them as JSON-text parser helpers.

## Implementation Plan

1. Add registry-backed hashing helpers under a logical function family.
2. Add registry-backed URL, JSON, and CSV scalar payload helpers under logical function families.
3. Add stable Substrait extension anchors for concrete helpers.
4. Keep `sha2(...)` as a compatibility rewrite over concrete helpers rather than a second mapping.
5. Add focused helper, registry, Substrait lowering, and DataFusion-backed session tests with concrete output values across the full helper set.
6. Add user-facing format-function docs and release notes.
7. Record semi-structured variant values as IncQL RFC 026 rather than accepting fake JSON-text predicates in RFC 022.
