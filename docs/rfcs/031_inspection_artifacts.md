## Summary

This RFC defines local inspection APIs and deterministic evidence artifacts for IncQL plans. The APIs expose plan structure, schema flow, lineage, metadata attachments, semantic profile evidence, ingress evidence, and diagnostics as typed records, while artifacts provide versioned serialized views suitable for CI, IDEs, agents, documentation, and downstream integrations.

## Motivation

Relational evidence is only useful if authors and tools can inspect it without scraping logs or formatted explanations. IncQL needs local APIs and artifacts that work without a hosted service, without a catalog product, and without executing the plan. This keeps plan inspection open, reproducible, and testable.

## Goals

- Define local inspection APIs over IncQL plans.
- Define deterministic artifact families for plan graph, lineage graph, schema flow, metadata attachments, semantic profiles, ingress mappings, client session context, and diagnostics.
- Require artifact versioning and unsupported-evidence markers.
- Keep human reports as projections from structured artifacts.

## Non-Goals

- Defining a UI, hosted artifact store, or managed catalog.
- Defining every external export mapping.
- Requiring plan execution before inspection.
- Making Markdown or console output the primary evidence format.

## Guide-level explanation (how authors think about it)

An author can inspect a lazy plan locally:

```incan
from pub::incql.inspect import inspect_plan

inspection = inspect_plan(summary)
inspection.output_schema()
inspection.lineage().field("total_amount")
```

The same inspection data can be written as artifacts for CI or downstream tools:

```incan
inspection.write_artifacts("target/incql")
```

The exact helper names are illustrative; the contract is that structured inspection exists before execution.

## Reference-level explanation (precise rules)

IncQL must expose a local inspection capability for plans that returns typed records, not only formatted strings.

Inspection records must include semantic targets, output schema information, relation structure, lineage when available, metadata attachments when available, semantic profile records or assessments when available, ingress origin mappings, client session context, and frontend coverage when available, diagnostics, and evidence-version metadata.

IncQL must define deterministic serialized artifacts for at least:

- plan graph
- lineage graph
- schema flow
- metadata attachments
- semantic profiles
- ingress mappings
- client session context
- diagnostics

Artifacts must include schema version, IncQL version, relevant rule versions, target identifiers, and unsupported-evidence markers. An empty lineage graph must be distinguishable from lineage that was not computed or is not supported.

Human-readable reports may exist, but they must be generated from structured inspection records or artifacts.

### Source identity ownership

Where an inspection record or artifact references a source location, that reference must derive from the compiler's canonical source symbol identity as defined by Incan RFC 120, projected through the shared codegraph of Incan RFC 106. IncQL must not define an independent identity scheme for source locations, and must not re-derive source identity from generated Rust or from a rendered projection.

IncQL owns relational semantic targets, plan structure, and lineage. The compiler owns source symbols, ranges, and their provenance and staleness. An inspection record joins the two by carrying both identities; it must not restate one in terms of the other.

Sensitive attachments must be redacted or omitted according to the visibility rules from IncQL RFC 029.

## Design details

### Syntax

This RFC introduces no language syntax.

### Semantics

Inspection is read-only. It must not execute a plan, bind physical sources, mutate Prism-authored meaning, or make policy decisions.

### Interaction with other IncQL surfaces

Method-chain, query-block, and future authoring surfaces should be inspectable through the same API once they lower to Prism.

### Compatibility / migration

Existing code remains valid. New tooling should prefer structured inspection over parsing `repr`, `debug`, or backend plan strings.

## Alternatives considered

- **Only expose formatted explanations.** Rejected because tools need structured data.
- **Only emit files, no API.** Rejected because IDEs and tests need in-memory inspection.
- **Wait for a higher-level catalog.** Rejected because local IncQL users need inspection without external services.

## Drawbacks

- Artifact schemas create compatibility obligations.
- Deterministic output may constrain internal representation changes.
- Multiple artifact families require clear documentation.

## Layers affected

- **IncQL specification** — local inspection becomes part of the relational evidence contract.
- **IncQL library package** — inspection APIs and artifact writers must expose structured records.
- **Execution / interchange** — no execution is required, but artifacts may reference Substrait lowering status.
- **Documentation** — docs must present artifacts as primary evidence and reports as derived views.

## Unresolved questions

- Which artifact serialization format should be mandatory first?
- Should artifact writing be part of the core package or a separate tooling module?
- How stable must artifact ordering be for snapshot tests and CI diffs?

## Implementation plan and checklist (non-normative)

This section tracks the implementation path for this RFC. It is intentionally operational and does not change the normative semantics above.

### Plan

1. Land typed inspection records over Prism-backed plans.
2. Land deterministic serialized artifacts for every required family.
3. Land a human-readable report generated strictly as a projection of those artifacts.

### Checklist

- [x] `inspect_plan(...)` and `inspect_lineage(...)` return typed records rather than formatted strings.
- [x] Artifact-family summaries carry schema version, IncQL version, status, and record counts.
- [x] An empty lineage graph is distinguishable from lineage that was not computed or is not supported.
- [x] Families exist for plan graph, lineage graph, schema flow, and metadata attachments.
- [ ] Deterministic serialized artifacts are written, not only summarized. The current `InspectionArtifact` record describes a family; it does not serialize one.
- [ ] A semantic profiles family exists (depends on IncQL RFC 040).
- [ ] An ingress mappings family exists (depends on IncQL RFC 041).
- [ ] A client session context family exists (depends on IncQL RFC 041).
- [ ] A human-readable report is generated from structured records or artifacts, satisfying this RFC's own goal that human reports remain projections.
- [ ] Source references derive from the compiler's canonical source symbol identity rather than an IncQL-defined scheme.

### Exit criteria for RFC status change

RFC 031 can move from `In Progress` to `Implemented` when every checklist item above is complete and the IncQL CI gate is green on the target release branch. Serialization is required rather than optional: this RFC exists to make evidence consumable by CI, editors, and agents, and a summary record does not make an artifact consumable. The three families that depend on IncQL RFCs 040 and 041 make this RFC's completion contingent on those RFCs landing.
